this is a playground to quickly set up a fresh starter of different software tools for quick testing and learning purposes.

I'll use Docker and Make as the basic tools to set up different environments quickly so you should have them installed on your system. The convenience is to just run `make <tool>` and have the tool up and running in a container.

## Currently supported tools
| Tool     | command                       | Notes
|----------|--------------------------------------| ---- |
| postgres | `make pg`        | gets you inside a psql shell connected to a local postgres instance |
